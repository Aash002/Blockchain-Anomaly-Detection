# Blockchain-Anomaly-Detection

This project employs machine learning to detect malicious transactions in blockchain networks, using Bitcoin transaction data (30M+ entries) and Python's PyOD library. Algorithms like K-means, HBOS, CBLOF, and Isolation Forest were implemented to identify anomalies, addressing class imbalance via SMOTE for enhanced minority-class detection. 

The analysis optimized computational efficiency and accuracy, revealing trade-offs between model complexity and performance. Results demonstrate robust anomaly detection capabilities, offering insights into blockchain security vulnerabilities. Future work includes real-time detection systems and deep learning integration. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, this project highlights data science's role in fortifying decentralized systems against cyber threats.
